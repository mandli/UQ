    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This class is an admittedly first attempt at constructing a course on uncertainty quantification (UQ) that will provide students with the tools used in the broad field of UQ.  Broadly speaking UQ is the combination of statistical methods to modeling situations.  This might involve the use of a PDE model or something simpler.  The primary driver though is to carry along statistical/probabilistic information through a complex model.  This can by uncertainty propagation, given a probability distribution function (PDF) of an input value what is the resulting PDF of an observed value, or something more complex such as data assimilation, the act of using observed data to correct numerical simulations, or inversion for the most likely input parameters given observables and a model.  Our focus during the semester will be on understanding the tools used in the field, giving you the basis for applying them and the ability to hopefully go further."
