    "## Purpose\n",
    "Welcome to your first course in numerical methods (maybe).  Numerical methods and computational science and engineering have often been said to comprise the \"third\" pillar of science if that gives you a scope for its applicability, so that's exciting.  We will cover a wide variety of topics to give you at least a taste as to the wide variety of uses these methods can have, exploring a large variety of these applications while studying each of the different topics.
